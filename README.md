# Latching Power Switch Circuit 
a circuit to control power, with a push button and automatic shut off after a set time.

## Components Used:
- Arduino 
- NMOS Transistor 
- Push button 
- LED
- 220Î© resistor ( 220 + 10k ohm )

## Wiring :
The MOSFET acts as an electronic switch to control power. The gate is connected to arduino D2  the drain to the LED cathode, while the source to GND.
